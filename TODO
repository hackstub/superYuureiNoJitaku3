- Collisions with object layer (i.e. cannot walk on closed doors)
- Smoother movements at least for monsters (x and y independently from each others)
- Monsters should look in the direction they're walking
- Refactorize sprites loading
- Lava should not block projectiles
- (Maybe monsters can be knockbacked on lava, take damage while they're on it?)
- Implement switches
- Implement chest
- Implement keys
- Several type of ennemies
- System for hero's life etc
- Smarter monster IA ?
- Boss ?
